**OpticalFlowTest** is a repository where I experiment with the Lucas-Kanade
method to generate optical flow from video input. I have also implemented a
datamosh effect as a sample application of the optical flow.

## System Requirements

 - Unity 6 or later
 - Universal Render Pipeline
 - A GPU with compute shader capability
